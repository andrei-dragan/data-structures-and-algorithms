# Data structures and algorithms

## Objectives
- Study of data structures (arrays, linked lists, heaps, hash tables, binary trees) that can be used to implement abstract data types.
- Study of the concept of abstract data type and the most frequently used abstract data types in application development.
- Study of the data structures that can be used to implement these abstract data types.
- Develop the ability to work with data stored in different data structures and to compare the complexities of their operations.
- Develop the ability to choose the appropriate data structure in order to model and solve real world problems.
- Acquire knowledge necessary to work with existing data structure/abstract data type libraries.
- Analyzing the issues around the main topics of graph: connectivity, shortest paths, modeling prerequisites and activity planning, flows, traveling salesman problem, planar graphs.
